# Group Assignment 4: Spatial Analysis

See the schedule in the syllabus for all assignment due dates and expectations. Group assignments need only one submission per group, so nominate a single submitter to submit on behalf of the whole group. You will be graded on your adherence to *all* the instructions. Please read the instructions carefully.

You will analyze the data you downloaded in assignment 1, and optionally other new data as needed. Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use geopandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed.

Join two datasets together (either a pandas merge or a geopandas spatial join). Project them to a sensible CRS. Using the mapping techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data. Create at least 3 maps. Each map should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains the map's interpretation, the projection that you chose to use, and what you are visualizing and why it is interesting: tell us its story. This story should be accompanied by any relevant descriptive statistics, as needed, to round out the picture.

At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each group member and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each).

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Click "Edit > Clear all outputs" and then "Runtime > Restart runtime". This clears your memory and re-initializes your notebook. Then click "Runtime > Run all" and make sure everything behaves properly. Then submit your notebook and your data file(s), all zipped together, via Blackboard.
