# Group Assignment 1: Collecting Data

Due Wed 29 Jan by 23:59 via Blackboard submission.

This course's final project requires you to identify a research question, collect data, analyze it, and discuss how your findings answer the question.

For this assignment, you will agree on a semester-long research topic and question for your group. This can be tweaked somewhat as the semester goes on, if needed, but for now I want you to have at least a working research topic and question. As an example, your research topic might be "transportation justice" and your question might be "are low-income communities subjected to more vehicular pollution than high-income communities, even though they tend to drive less?"

Next you will identify and download datasets from at least two different sources (for example, the census bureau and the LA city data portal) that you believe will help you answer this question. If you cannot find data from two sources to address your question, then it is likely not an appropriate question for the purposes of this course. At least one of your datasets must have a spatial component (such as latitude-longitude points, or building footprints, or census tracts, or anything else explicitly spatial).

Write a 2-3 page paper that does the following. First, explain your research topic, its context, and its importance. Second, state and explain your research question and any expectations you have going into it. Third, document the datasets you have downloaded, including 1) the data sources; 2) the data contents such as variable names, descriptions, and units of analysis; 3) how you believe these data will help you answer your research question. Submit this paper as a PDF.
