## Preparatory Notes

See the schedule in the syllabus for all due dates and expectations.

Notetaking is a core life skill for active learning and retention. Here we ask you to engage thoughtfully with the course material so you can come to class prepared to put it into practice. Your notes should cover the week's required pre-class prep materials (see "pre-class prep" each week in the syllabus's schedule). Typed notes should be submitted as a PDF file, single-spaced, in 12-point Times New Roman font, 2-4 pages in length.

Rubric:
  - did you restate in your own words (don't copy/paste) the main points of the main sections of the pre-class prep materials?
  - did you follow the formatting and submission instructions?
  - did you adhere to the syllabus policies regarding AI, plagiarism, quoting, and citing?
