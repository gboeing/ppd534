## Preparatory Notes

See the schedule in the syllabus for all due dates and expectations.

Notetaking is a core life skill for active learning. Here we ask you to engage thoughtfully with the course material so you can come to class prepared to put it into practice. Typed notes should be submitted as a PDF file, single-spaced, composed in 12-point Times New Roman font, 6 pages long at maximum. If you handwrite the prep notes, the page limit is 8 pages and please compile the images into a PDF file for submission. The page limit will go into effect starting with prep notes 3 in Fall 2025.

We expect the prep notes to cover, at least, the required readings listed under "Pre-class prep" for the corresponding week. For example, for prep notes 1 that is due on the Sunday before the Sep 2 session, you need check out the "Pre-class prep" outlined under [Sep 2 - Research Design and Data Collection](https://github.com/gboeing/ppd534/tree/main/syllabus#sep-2---research-design-and-data-collection) in syllabus, where you can find:

Pre-class prep:
- Wheelan, Naked Statistics, intro + ch. 1
- Urdan, Statistics in Plain English, ch. 1. [USC link](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/socal/reader.action?docID=3060431).
