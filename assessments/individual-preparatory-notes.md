## Preparatory Notes

See the schedule in the syllabus for all due dates and expectations.

Notetaking is a core life skill for active learning. Here we ask you to engage thoughtfully with the course material so you can come to class prepared to put it into practice. Typed notes should be submitted as a PDF file, single-spaced, composed in 12-point Times New Roman font, 6 pages long at maximum. If you handwrite the prep notes, the page limit is 8 pages and please compile the images into a PDF file for submission. The page limit will go into effect starting with prep notes #3 in Fall 2025.

Rubric:
  - did you summarize the main sections of the pre-class prep materials?
  - did you restate in your own words the main points from each section of the prep materials?
  - did you following the formatting instructions?
  - did you adhere to the syllabus policy on AI, plagiarism, and citations?
