# Mid-term Exam

## Time and format

The exam will occur in-person during our regularly scheduled class session. See the schedule in the syllabus for the date. The exam is timed and you will have 90 minutes to complete it. It will cover material from the beginning of the semester through the exam week. Its content and format will be similar to the problem sets, so use your prior experience with them as a template for what and how to study.

## Session logistics

You must complete the exam with a blue or black ink pen (so make sure to bring one and a backup) and ensure your handwriting is legible so we can read your responses without ambiguity.

You cannot re-enter the classroom if you leave once the exam has begun. If you must leave the room for any reason, turn in your exam for grading on your way out.

If you have a clarifying question during the exam, please ask the instructor privately. Do not communicate with your classmates during the exam and do not reveal anything to your classmates (including when asking a question) that could hint at an exam question's solution: this would be an academic integrity violation.

## Devices and materials

No books, laptops, phones, or other devices are allowed out during the exam session. Keep them secured in your bag at all times. You can bring and use the prep notes you have submitted (as long as they conformed to the prep notes guidelines) but no other notes or materials of any kind.

Relax and come to the exam well-rested. If you've been putting in the work all semester, you'll do fine.
