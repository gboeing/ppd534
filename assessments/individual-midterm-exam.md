# Midterm Exam

See the schedule in the syllabus for the date of the midterm exam. The exam will occur in-person during our regular class session time that day.

The exam is timed and you will have 90 minutes to complete it. It is open note. The exam will cover material from the beginning of the semester through this week. If you have a clarifying question during the exam, please ask the instructor privately. Do not communicate with your classmates during the exam and do not reveal anything to your classmates (including when asking a question) that could hint at an exam question's solution: this would be an academic integrity violation.

No books, laptops, phones, or other devices are allowed.

You can bring/use the prep notes you have submitted, as long as they conform to the assignment guidelines, but no other notes.

You cannot leave and re-enter the room once the exam has begun. If you must leave the room for any reason, turn in your exam for grading on your way out.

Relax and come to the exam well-rested. If you've been putting in the work all semester, you'll do fine.
