# Group Peer Review

At the end of the semester, group members will assess one another with a confidential peer review to help determine final grades. You will receive no points for the peer review if you do not submit yours by the deadline.

Please provide honest feedback: your responses will be kept private. As we cannot observe all of your group interactions and divisions of labor throughout the semester, we rely on these peer assessments to allocate final grades based on the group's confidential consensus. Bear in mind: this does mean that overall group grades are not perfect barometers of your individual performance in the course, as your own final grade will shift up or down based on your own contributions to the group.
