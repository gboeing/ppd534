# Individual In-Class Problem Sets

See the schedule in the syllabus for all dates and expectations.

Problem sets help you exercise the core learning outcomes in this course by putting them into practice through recall and application. They cover core knowledge and takeaways from the pre-class prep materials and in-class lectures and activities. There are no trick questions: just applications of the necessary skills and knowledge to meet the course's core learning outcomes. To prepare for a problem set, complete the week's prep notes and any practice notebooks thoroughly and thoughtfully prior to the in-class lecture and activities.

Problem sets are in-person during our regularly scheduled class sessions. You must complete the problem sets with a blue or black ink pen (so make sure to bring one plus a backup) and ensure your handwriting is legible so we can read your responses without ambiguity. No notes, books, laptops, phones, or other materials are allowed out while completing a problem set.

If you have a clarifying question during a problem set, please ask the instructor privately. Do not communicate with your classmates and do not reveal anything to your classmates (including when asking a question) that could hint at a problem's solution: this would be an academic integrity violation.
