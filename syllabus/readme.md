# Course Description

This course provides you with a toolkit for telling stories with urban data. It will introduce basic coding, stats, and reasoning with evidence.

The course takes a computational social science approach to working with data. It uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to introduce coding and statistical methods that students can reproduce and experiment with in real-time in the classroom. We start the semester with the basics of coding, then move on to data loading and analysis, then on to basic statistics, then hypotheses and the scientific method, and finally a critical assessment of smart cities and urban informatics.

Each week, students will be expected to:

  - Complete and be prepared to discuss all assigned readings
  - Complete and submit any assigned reading responses
  - Attend the lecture
  - Complete and submit any assigned group projects

The course has no specific prerequisites. Coding itself will be taught from the ground-up. However, this course requires a lot of patience: learning to code will take lots of trial-and-error, self-direction, practice, repetition, and experimentation on your part. You will get out of it what you are willing to put into it. Please note that this syllabus is a living document and may be updated by the instructor during the semester as needed.




# Learning Objectives

  - Write simple code to manipulate, analyze, and visualize urban data
  - Understand how to use basic descriptive and inferential statistics to evaluate and interpret social science evidence
  - Tell stories using a combination of text and visuals about public issues using data and evidence
  - Evaluate the politics and ethics underlying how technology and innovation impact cities and planning processes




# Questions and Assistance

We are available if you need help throughout the semester and are happy to answer your questions. By email, you should expect a reply typically within approximately one working day. Office hours info is provided at the beginning of the syllabus.

## Who to contact

If you have a question about class material, homework, or a coding/data problem, contact the TA first. If you have a specific question for the professor outside of those categories, please sign up for an office hours slot to chat.

## How to ask a technical question

Given the nature of this course, we do expect a few things of you before you seek assistance with coding/data questions:

  1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
  2. Search google and stackoverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you're struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
  3. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
  4. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights

If the above steps haven't solved your problem, send an email (or attend office hours) and include the following information:

  1. A detailed description of what you're trying to do, why, and how
  2. A [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your code so far (never send screenshots of code)
  3. What you've already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it (specifically, explain the results of steps 1-4 above, including relevant links from stackoverflow etc)

We do not ask for this to be pedantic. Rather, we need it to be able to help you solve your code problem.




# Materials

Due to copyright, course reading materials will be shared on blackboard for enrolled students to freely download. The course lectures assume that you have read the assigned readings prior to the class session and are now reasonably fluent in their contents and ready to discuss/debate them in class.

Coursework will be based on free open-source software.




# Assignments and Evaluation

Per USC guidelines, for each course unit the university expects 2 hours of out-of-class student work per week. This is a 4 unit course. Therefore, you should expect an average of 8 hours of out-of-class work each week. The balance will vary from week to week, but will comprise a mix of individual reading, individual writing, and group data/code assignments. See the schedule below for assignment due dates and see the "assignments" folder for instructions. Active participation is expected (and graded) in the classroom.

Final grades will be assigned according to the following, for a total of 1000 points:

  - 200 points: 8 individual reading responses × 25 points each
  - 300 points: 5 group projects × 60 points each
  - 200 points: midterm exam
  - 200 points: final group project
  - 100 points: active participation in classroom and team work

Assignments must be submitted via Blackboard by 23:59 pacific time on their due date. Late assignment submissions will be deducted 20% per day. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded.

# Academic Conduct and Support

## Accommodations and Extensions

Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability or ongoing mental health concern is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, as the accommodation can only be implemented upon receipt of the letter. Visit DSP's [web site](https://dsp.usc.edu/) for more details. For further support, I encourage you to contact USC Support and Advocacy (uscsupport@usc.edu). To maintain fairness and equality for all students, extensions to due dates are only granted in accordance with these official accommodation letters. If you need to request a *one-time emergency* extension (e.g., due to a major illness or to a death in the family) you must do the following proactively *prior to the due date*: 1) provide written documentation (such as an official doctor's note) explaining that you are unable to complete the assignment by its due date and 2) work out an extension with the instructor.

## Academic Integrity

USC seeks to maintain an optimal learning environment. General principles of academic honesty include the concept of respect for the intellectual property of others, the expectation that individual work will be submitted unless otherwise allowed by an instructor, and the obligations both to protect one's own academic work from misuse by others as well as to avoid using another's work as one's own. Plagiarism (presenting someone else's ideas or work as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words) is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. This includes submitting code that someone else wrote. All students are expected to understand and abide by these principles. See the [student handbook](https://scampus.usc.edu) for more details.
