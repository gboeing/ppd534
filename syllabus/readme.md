# Course Description

This course provides you with a toolkit for telling stories with urban data. It will introduce basic coding, stats, and reasoning with evidence. The course takes a computational social science approach to working with data. It uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to introduce coding and statistical methods that you can reproduce and experiment with in real-time in the classroom. We start the semester with the basics of coding, then move on to data loading and analysis, then on to basic statistics, then hypotheses and the scientific method, and finally a critical assessment of smart cities and urban informatics.

Each week, students will be expected to:

- Complete and be prepared to discuss assigned readings and videos
- Complete and submit any learning assessments due
- Attend the class session

The course presumes a basic working knowledge of the Python language. This course requires patience and practice: learning to code will take lots of trial-and-error, self-direction, repetition, and experimentation on your part. You will get out of it what you are willing to put into it. Please note that this syllabus is a living document and may be updated by the instructor during the semester as needed.

# Learning Objectives

- Write simple code to manipulate, analyze, and visualize urban data
- Understand how to use basic descriptive and inferential statistics to evaluate and interpret social science evidence
- Tell stories about public issues with a combination of text and visuals using data and evidence
- Evaluate the politics and ethics underlying how technology impacts cities and planning processes

# Questions and Assistance

We are available if you need help throughout the semester and are happy to answer your questions. Please ask course-related questions in our course's Slack channel: you should expect a reply typically within two working days. If you have a sensitive personal matter to discuss, please ask by email. Office hours info is provided at the beginning of the syllabus.

## Who to contact

If you have a question about class material, homework, or a coding/data problem: post on Slack or drop by the TA's office hours. If you have a specific question for the professor outside of those categories, please drop by his office hours to chat.

## How to ask a technical question

Given the nature of this course, we do expect a few things of you before you seek assistance with coding/data questions:

1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
2. Search Google and StackOverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you're struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
3. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
4. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights
5. Ask your teammates if they have any insight

If the above steps haven't solved your problem, post on Slack (or attend office hours) and include the following information:

1. A detailed description of what you're trying to do, why, and how
2. A complete [minimal reproducible example](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports) of your code so far (never send screenshots of code/tracebacks)
3. What you've already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it so far (specifically, explain the results of steps 1-4 above, including relevant links from StackOverflow etc)

We do not ask for this to be pedantic. Rather, we need it to be able to help you solve your issue and avoid the [XY Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem).

# Materials

Coursework will be based on free open-source software. Copyrighted course reading materials are available via Brightspace for enrolled students to download. The course lectures assume that you have read the assigned readings prior to the class session and are now reasonably fluent in their contents and ready to discuss/debate them in class. Lectures are supplemental to the assigned reading and are of little value if you haven't taken the time to prepare in advance. So, before class, make sure you have completed the assigned reading, taken thorough notes, and prepared any questions you may have about the material.

# Coursework

The following sections outline the work you agree to do by enrolling in this course. Per USC guidelines, for each course unit the university expects 2 hours of out-of-class student work per week. This is a 4 unit course. Therefore, you should expect an average of 8 hours of out-of-class work each week. Please budget your time accordingly. See the schedule below for learning assessment due dates and see the "assessments" folder for instructions.

## Attendance Policy

This is an in-person course. Students are expected to manage their schedules such that they can keep all of their commitments, including attending class. If you need to miss a class session, do not notify the instructor: attendance is not taken, so there are no "excused" versus "unexcused" absences, nor are there accommodations for missing in-class activities. It is the student's responsibility to request notes, etc from others who were in attendance.

## Submission Policy

Submissions are due by 23:59:00 Pacific Time on their stated due dates (see schedule below). Submit everything via Brightspace's submission system.

Please submit early to avoid any last-minute headaches such as slow uploads, connectivity problems, or temporary system outages. If you have any technical issues when submitting, contact USC IT for resolution well before it is due. It is solely the student's responsibility to ensure that all submissions have gone through on time and contain the complete, working, correct files. Double-check and verify correct and successful submission, and fix it if necessary, before the deadline. You are graded solely on what you submit on Brightspace prior to the deadline. The timestamp in the submission system is our only official record: if it says you're late, you're late. Submissions outside of Brightspace (e.g., by email or on Google Drive) will not be accepted or graded. If your data set is too large for the submission system, you may upload *only your data set* to the USC Google Drive and provide a link to it in the first cell of your submitted Jupyter notebook that uses it.

## Late Policy and Extensions

The professional world demands punctuality, which we practice in this course through relatively strict deadlines. However, sometimes things come up and we could use a little grace. Each assessment comes with a 12-hour, no-questions-asked grace period following its deadline during which it will be accepted as though on-time (does not apply to exams or final projects). You can submit after that for a 25% penalty until the submission system closes completely 24 hours after the original deadline.

You additionally have two "free drops" that you can use to drop any individual assessments (does not apply to group work or exams). Just submit a free drop on Brightspace, identify the assessment to drop in the comment box, and we will set its grade to 100%. Do not notify the instructor: you don't have to ask for permission, or justify it, or provide documentation. This offers you some grace without having to share private information about your personal circumstances, family, or health. For example, use a free drop to stay home sick and not worry about losing points for an in-class activity that day. Or use one to take a week off if an emergency occurs, such as sudden hospitalization or a death in the family. But save them for when you really need them: if you require more than these two free drops, you must get an OSAS accommodation for additional extensions.

## Grading Policy

You can expect the grade you earned to be posted within two weeks of each assessment's due date. Grades are earned solely based on how well submissions fulfill the instructions and demonstrate your proficiency in the material. Effort and time spent do not factor in to grades. If your demonstrated proficiency is not where you want it to be, start coming to office hours, refocus your effort onto more effective study strategies, and optionally consider tutoring services.

Posted grades are final and non-negotiable. This policy exists to protect you and ensure equitable outcomes for both you and your classmates. Professors don't arbitrarily hand out grades, and thus they should never arbitrarily alter them either. Accordingly, no grade disputes regarding the grader's judgment and standards will be considered. However, if we have made an arithmetic error in inputting your grade (e.g., you earned a certain number of points but we summed them incorrectly in the final grade), please provide specific documentation of that clerical error and we'll be happy to correct it.

Final grade weighting (there is no extra credit):

  - 10%: ten individual preparatory notes
  - 25%: ten individual in-class problem sets
  - 25%: individual midterm exam
  - 25%: five group assignments
  - 10%: final group project and presentation
  - 5%:  peer review

Final grade percentage ranges and meaning:

  - 90 ≤ A (high pass)
  - 80 ≤ B < 90 (pass)
  - 70 ≤ C < 80 (low pass)
  - 60 ≤ D < 70 (fail)
  - F < 60 (fail)

# Academic Conduct and Support

## Accommodations

USC welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs. The Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter disability-related barriers. Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at https://osas.usc.edu/. You may contact OSAS at (213) 740-0776 or osasfrontdesk@usc.edu.

To maintain fairness and equity for all students, exceptions to syllabus policies are only granted in accordance with official LOAs. There are no retroactive accommodations negotiable after deadlines. There is no accommodation for travel: it's the student's responsibility to know the school schedule before they book travel and to adjust travel dates as needed. Course content and classroom discussion may deal with topics that you find difficult or upsetting but are relevant to the course. It is your responsibility to review the syllabus to be aware of upcoming content so you can prepare for it adequately. Contact OSAS for an LOA if you require an accommodation.

## Plagiarism and AI

Review the student handbook for expectations on academic integrity and understand what constitutes [plagiarism](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism). Do not reproduce any words, images, code, or other content created by another author (including AI) without quote marks and citation. If you instead refer to their ideas in your own words, you must cite them to make it clear whose ideas you're referring to. Content generated from AI or similar tools including ChatGPT and Google Translate may be submitted in this course (except where expressly prohibited) in accordance with the preceding plagiarism guidelines. You are solely responsible for any submitted content: false claims and fake references, regardless of their origin, are academic integrity violations, so review all content carefully before submission.

## Academic Conduct

Recording a university class in any form (including photography, video, and audio) is forbidden without the express permission of the instructor and announcement to the class, or unless conducted pursuant to an OSAS accommodation. Recording can inhibit free discussion in the future, and thus infringe on the academic freedom of other students as well as the instructor. Distribution or use of notes, recordings, exams, or other intellectual property based on university classes or lectures for purposes other than individual or group study is forbidden without the express permission of the instructor. This includes but is not limited to providing materials for distribution by services publishing course materials. This restriction on unauthorized use also applies to all information which had been distributed to students or in any way had been displayed for use in relationship to the class, whether obtained in class, via email, on the internet, or via any other media. Refer to the USC Student Handbook for further details.

The University of Southern California is foremost a learning community committed to fostering successful scholars and researchers dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas. Academic misconduct is contrary to this fundamental mission and includes any act of dishonesty in the submission of academic work (either in draft or final form), as well as cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g., falsifying data), knowingly assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty, and any act that gains or is intended to gain an unfair academic advantage. Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity in all coursework.

This course follows the expectations for academic integrity as stated in the USC Student Handbook. All students are expected to submit assignments that are original work and prepared specifically for the course/section in this academic term. Students may not submit work written by others or "recycle" work prepared for other courses without obtaining written permission from the instructor(s). Students suspected of academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. Academic dishonesty has a far-reaching impact and is considered a serious offense against the university. Violations will result in a grade penalty, such as a failing grade on the assignment or in the course, and disciplinary action from the university, such as suspension or expulsion. For more information about academic integrity see the Student Handbook, the Office of Academic Integrity's website, and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct.

## Classroom Norms

Our classroom adheres to four central norms of professionalism:

  - We respect others' opinions, but defer to facts.
  - We give honest criticism, but keep it constructive and courteous.
  - We alone are responsible for our own actions.
  - We adhere to the syllabus, so the squeaky wheel does not gain an advantage over their peers.
