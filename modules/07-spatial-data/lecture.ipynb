    "## 1. Quick overview of key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is GIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "GIS stands for geographic information system. GIS software lets you work with spatial data, that is, data associated with locations on the Earth. These locations are represented with coordinates: longitude (x), latitude (y), and often elevation (z). With GIS software you can collect, edit, query, analyze, and visualize spatial data. Examples of GIS software include ArcGIS, QGIS, PostGIS, and GeoPandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **geoid**: (that's *gee-oid*) the surface of the earth's gravity field, which approximates mean sea level\n",
    "- **spheroid** or **ellipsoid** (interchangeable terms): a model that smoothly approximates the geoid\n",
    "- **datum**: based on spheroid but incorporates local variations in the shape of the Earth. Used to describe a point on the Earth's surface, such as in latitude and longitude.\n",
    "  - WGS84 (World Geodetic Survey 1984 datum) uses the WGS84 spheroid\n",
    "  - The latitude and longitude coordinates of some point differ slightly based on the datum. GPS uses WGS84.\n",
    "- **coordinate reference system** (CRS) or spatial reference system (SRS): a series of parameters that [define](http://spatialreference.org/) the coordinate system and spatial extent (aka, domain) of some dataset.\n",
    "- **geographic coordinate system** (GCS): specifies a datum, spheroid, units of measure (such as meters), and a prime meridian\n",
    "- **projected coordinate system** or map projection: projects a map of the Earth's 3-D spherical surface onto a flat surface that can be measured in units like meters. Here's a [list of projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections).\n",
    "- **eastings** and **northings**: the x and y coordinates of a projected map, usually measured in meters\n",
    "- **false origin**: the 0,0 origin point from which eastings and northings are measured on a map, usually the lower left corner rather than the center\n",
    "- **PROJ.4**: a library to convert/project spatial data with consistent CRS [parameter names](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/wiki/GenParms)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common CRS parameters (and their PROJ.4 names):\n",
    "\n",
    "- datum (datum)\n",
    "- ellipse (ellps)\n",
    "- projection (proj)\n",
    "  - the name of the projected coordinate system, such as Albers Equal Area (aea) or Lambert Conformal Conic (lcc)\n",
    "- standard parallels (lat_1, lat_2)\n",
    "  - where the projection surface touches the globe - at the standard parallels, the projection shows no distortion\n",
    "- central meridian and latitude of origin (lon_0, lat_0)\n",
    "  - the origin of the projection's x and y coordinates (eastings and northings) - usually the center of the map projection\n",
    "- false easting and false northing (x_0, y_0)\n",
    "  - offsets to add to all your eastings and northings - usually used to make all the coordinates on the map positive numbers by starting 0,0 at the lower left corner rather than the center of the map (see false origin, above)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common projection types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *equal area* projections: maintain area at the expense of shape, distance, and direction - such as the [Albers Equal Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection) projection\n",
    "- *conformal* projections: maintain shapes at the expense of area, distance, and direction - such as the [Lambert Conformal Conic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_conformal_conic_projection) projection\n",
    "- *equidistant* projections: [preserve distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection#Equidistant) from one point or along all meridians and parallels\n",
    "- *azimuthal* projections: maintain direction from one point to all other points - such as an [orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection_in_cartography) projection\n",
    "- others compromise to minimize overall distortion or aim for aesthetic value - such as the [Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection) projection"

    "## 2. Loading spatial data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a GIS like ArcGIS or QGIS to open a spatial data file (typically a shapefile, GeoJSON file, or CSV file with lat-long columns). Today we'll introduce the basic concepts of spatial data and GIS operations using [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/user.html), which spatializes pandas dataframes. It uses the [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) package for geometry.
