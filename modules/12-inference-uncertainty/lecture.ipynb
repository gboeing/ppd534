    "Statistical inference is the process of using a sample to *infer* the characteristics of an underlying population (from which this sample was drawn) through estimation and hypothesis testing. Contrast this with descriptive statistics, which focus simply on describing the characteristics of the sample itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common goals of inferential statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - parameter estimation and confidence intervals\n",
    "  - hypothesis rejection\n",
    "  - prediction\n",
    "  - model selection\n",

    "Throughout, we will utilize the \"frequentist\" statistical paradigm:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - frequentists think of probability as proportion of time some outcome occurs (relative frequency)\n",
    "  - given lots of repeated trials, how likely is the observed outcome?\n",
    "  - central concepts: statistical hypothesis testing, *p*-values, confidence intervals"
